# Linear regression on Ames housing dataset.
This project performs a simple multiple linear regression on the Ames Housing dataset using two features: **Gr_Liv_Area** and **Garage_Area** to predict **SalePrice**. 
All analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook: `Linear_Regression_Ames_2.ipynb`.

---

##  Objective

To analyse the relationship between the three ('Gr_Liv_Area', 'Garage_Area` and 'Sale_Price') variables and build a multiple linear regression model to predict
the sales prices based on the 'Gr_Liv_Area' and 'Garage_Area` variables.

---

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Load and preview the Data.
- Read `ames.csv` into a DataFrame using pandas.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing & duplicate values and ensured data types were correct for modeling.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the relationship in our features od interest using a correlation matrix

### 4. Feature Selection
- Selected `Gr_Liv_Area` and `Garage_Area` as independent variables (predictors).
- Set `SalePrice` as the dependent variable (the response).

### Build simple linear regression models for each independent variable vs the dependent variable.

### Create a multimple linear regression

### Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into training and test sets (75% train, 25% test).

### Visualising the distribution of the data before data scaling
- Plot a pairplot of our independent variables to visualise their distribution
- Decided on normalizing the data because it does not follow a Gaussian' distribution.


### Fit the model on the training data
- Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression()` from `scikit-learn`.

### Model Parameters
- Printed model intercept and coefficients.

### Prediction & Evaluation
- Predicted sale prices on the test set.
- Evaluated model using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  
### Error Visualization
- Plotted predicted vs actual values to show model performance.

### Interpretation
- Interpreted coefficients to understand the effect of each variable on price.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Strong positive correlation between living area and sale price.
- Garage area also contributes to predicting sale price, but to a lesser extent.
- More features may be added to our model to improve performance.
